# ✨ PixisProd

**`Serving logic. Forging structure. Standing by uptime.`**  

When it comes to code, I'm quite the perfectionist.
I love when everything works 100% as intended, and I often read best practices just to calm my soul, knowing that my code is solid.

I enjoy designing project architecture.
Even as a kid, I loved watching how engineers planned physical structures — now I do the same, just not with buildings, but with systems.
That’s exactly why I fell in love with backend development, especially with FastAPI — it's flexible and doesn’t tie your hands like Django does, at least in terms of the architecture I value so much.

In projects, I care about scalability and code cleanliness, because they let me focus on what matters without getting lost in repetitive tasks.
I dislike rewriting chunks of code (not to be confused with refactoring) just because something wasn’t well thought out in the beginning — partly because I’m afraid I might miss something, and partly because it’s stressful and tedious to me.

That’s why in every project I touch, I try to lay the foundation with the future in mind.
